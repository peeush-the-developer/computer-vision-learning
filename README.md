## OpenCV 101

This is the most basic course to understand how we can use OpenCV for image processing techniques. Following are the operations we can perform:
+ Load image from disk
+ Display image
+ Manipulate individual or set of pixel values
+ Drawing shapes over image (like, drawing a rectangle around face to mark face recognition, etc.)
+ Translating pixel co-ordinates from one point to another
+ Rotate an image on a point in image
+ Resize an image maintaining aspect ratio
