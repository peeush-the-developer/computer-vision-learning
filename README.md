## OpenCV 101

This is the most basic thing to understand how we can use OpenCV for image processing techniques. Following are the operations we can perform:

- [Load image from disk](OpenCV-101/1.opencv-load-image/load_image_opencv.py)
- [Manipulate individual or set of pixel values](OpenCV-101/2.opencv-getting-setting/opencv_getting_setting.py)
- [Drawing shapes over image (like, drawing a rectangle around face to mark face recognition, etc.)](OpenCV-101/3.opencv-drawing/image_drawing.py)
- [Translating pixel co-ordinates from one point to another](OpenCV-101/4.opencv-translate/opencv_translate.py)
- [Rotate an image on a point in image](OpenCV-101/5.opencv-rotate/opencv_rotate.py)
- [Resize an image maintaining aspect ratio](OpenCV-101/6.opencv-resizing/opencv_resize.py)
